# compdisteval

A collection of code written for compositional distributional semantics.
Features include:
- Creating vector embeddings from a corpus (co-occurrence, word2vec, GloVe, FastText)
- Creating tensor embeddings from a corpus
- Running experiments on a number of datasets for evaluating composition models


Little note: this repository contains slightly modified versions of the InferSent repository ([here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent)) and the Skip-Thoughts repository ([here](https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts))
